Intercept, vehicle length, and ground clearance are unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model.
In the other words, they provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset
They have a significant impact on mpg.
The slope of the linear model should not be considered 0. If it is 0, there is no significant relationship between mpg and other vairables.
The linear model can be considered to predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively. R-squared:  0.7032 is greater than 50%, and it is not overfitting due to some significant variables.


Suspension_Coil statistics summary:
mean: 1499.531
median: 1499.747
std_dev: 8.731242
variance: 76.23459

Using ggplot, we can see that the data is normally distributed. The plot shows that PSI ranges from 1460-1520 pounds per inch. That means that the supspension coils do not excedd 100 pounds per inch from the mean of 1500. 
And 98% suspension coils fall closely to 1500 pounds-per-inch ( 3 std_dev from mean). In conclusion, current manufacturing data meet the design specification.


Suspension Coil T-Test
One Sample t-test: p-value = 0.2392 > 0.05 significant level.
The suspension coil’s pound-per-inch results are not statistically different from the mean population results of 1,500 pounds-per-inch.

Do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis: "There is no statistical difference between the observed sample mean and its presumed population mean."
Two means are statistically similar.

Design Your Own Study: statistical study can quantify how MechaCar outperforms the competition
Metrics to be consider: horse power, selling price, fuel effeciency, size (weight, length, height), mpg.
Questions to be asks: How significant differences in statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, variance) between each MechaCar's metrics and Industry Average's;
	Null hypothesis: There is no statistical difference between the MechaCar sample mean and Industry sample population mean.
	Alternative hypothesis: There is significant statistical difference (less or more) between the MechaCar sample mean and Industry sample population mean.
Statistical tests to be run: two-sample t-test, one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA.
Data to be collected: MechaCar's virals data, Industry Averages data.
